# T.WIKI-education-000
Project to create a functional TiddlyWiki for education purposes with different tiers of access for teachers and students, as to support management of course materials and course tasks for groups as well as allowing feedback and evaluation for students on an individual basis. 
The project consists initially of a single Tiddlywiki html file hosted on GH pages, where it can be accessed and tested -and being a quine, can also be forked. 
Educational image and pdf files are not embedded but linked to, and reside in a files folder in the repository.
Educational videos are not embedded either, but hosted on dedicated services where they can be linked to.
